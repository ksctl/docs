## ðŸ†• Whatâ€™s New in Ksctl v2.2.1?

### Now Instance types are categorized based on the workload

*No need to know which instancetype falls under which category. Just select the category and ksctl will take care of the rest.*

Here is the new categorization of instance types wrt to the cluster type you have selected:

- Self managed
  - Controlplane: ComputeIntensive
  - Etcd: MemoryIntensive
  - Loadbabalancer: GeneralPurpose
  - WorkerNode: User defined (ComputeIntensive | MemoryIntensive | GeneralPurpose | Burstable)
- Managed
  - Controlplane: Managed so no option
  - WorkerNode: User defined (ComputeIntensive | MemoryIntensive | GeneralPurpose | Burstable)

> All these will help increase the performance and also reduce the cost of the cluster.

| Category | Amazon Web Services | Microsoft Azure |
| - | - | - |
| cpu-intensive | c5 | F-series |
| memory-intensive | r5 | E-series |
| general-purpose | m5 | D-series |
| burstable | t3 | B-series |
