## 🌟 What’s New in Ksctl v2.4?

### 📌 **Dynamic Region Switching for Cost & Emission Optimization**

Ksctl can now **switch regions** to optimize costs while maintaining the same instance type. This feature ensures that your clusters run in both the **most cost-effective** and **least emission** region without manual intervention.

- 🚀 **Automatically identifies and switches to one of the best-priced regions**
- 🛠️ **Option to keep your cluster in the current region** if preferred
- 💰 **Reduces infrastructure costs** by dynamically adapting to pricing changes across regions
- 🌱 **Minimizes carbon footprint** by selecting regions with lower emission

> This feature ensures you get **maximum cost efficiency** and **minimum emissions** while maintaining performance and reliability.

> This feature works with the `ksctl cluster create` command.
