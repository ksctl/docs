# 🚀 Ksctl v2.4: Smarter Cost & Emission Optimization for Dynamic Region Switching

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Ksctl v2.4**! This update introduces **Dynamic Region Switching**, an intelligent cost and emission optimization feature that helps you minimize infrastructure expenses by selecting the most efficient region for your Kubernetes clusters—without changing your instance type.

## 🌟 What’s New in Ksctl v2.4?

### 📌 **Dynamic Region Switching for Cost & Emission Optimization**

Ksctl can now **switch regions** to optimize costs while maintaining the same instance type. This feature ensures that your clusters run in both the **most cost-effective** and **least emission** region without manual intervention.
- 🚀 **Automatic Region Optimization**: Ksctl intelligently identifies and switches to the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly regions.
- 🛠️ **Flexible Region Control**: Prefer to stay in your current region? You can opt to keep your cluster where it is.
- 💰 **Cost Savings**: Dynamically adapts to pricing changes across regions, reducing your infrastructure expenses.
- 🌱 **Eco-Friendly Operations**: Minimizes carbon footprint by selecting regions based on:
    - **Direct Carbon Intensity**: (Lower is better) Measures the carbon emissions from energy production.
    - **LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) Carbon Intensity**: (Lower is better) Evaluates the lifecycle carbon emissions of energy sources.
    - **Renewable Power Percentage**: (Higher is better) Highlights regions with higher renewable energy usage.
    - **Low CO₂ Power Percentage**: (Higher is better) Focuses on regions with a lower share of carbon-intensive power.

> This feature ensures you get **maximum cost efficiency** and **minimum emissions** while maintaining performance and reliability.

> This feature works with the `ksctl cluster create` command.
