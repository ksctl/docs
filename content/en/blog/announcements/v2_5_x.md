# ğŸš€ Ksctl v2.5: Smart selection for Region and InstanceType

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Ksctl v2.5**! This update introduces **Smart Card Selection**, an intelligent feature that helps you select the best region and instance type for your Kubernetes clusters based on your requirements.

## ğŸŒŸ Whatâ€™s New in Ksctl v2.5?

### ğŸ“Œ **Region Selection Sorted based on Emission Optimization**

Ksctl can help you choose the most efficient region based on emission metrics, ensuring that your Kubernetes clusters are not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly.
- ğŸŒ± **Minimizes carbon footprint** by prioritizing regions with lower emissions, contributing to a greener environment.
- ğŸš€ **Automatically ranks regions** using advanced emission metrics, including:
    - **Direct Carbon Intensity**: (Lower is better) Measures the carbon emissions from energy production.
    - **LCA Carbon Intensity**: (Lower is better) Evaluates the lifecycle carbon emissions of energy sources.
    - **Renewable Power Percentage**: (Higher is better) Highlights regions with higher renewable energy usage.
    - **Low COâ‚‚ Power Percentage**: (Higher is better) Focuses on regions with a lower share of carbon-intensive power.

This intelligent selection ensures your Kubernetes clusters are deployed in regions that align with both cost-efficiency and sustainability goals.

### ğŸ“Œ **Instance Type Selection Sorted based on Cost and Embodied Emissions Optimization**

Ksctl can help you choose the most efficient instance type based on cost and embodied emissions, ensuring that your Kubernetes clusters are not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly.
- ğŸ’° **Cost Optimization**: Dynamically adapts to pricing changes across instance types, reducing infrastructure costs.
- ğŸŒ± **Sustainability Focus**: Prioritizes instance types with lower embodied emissions, minimizing your carbon footprint. Automatically ranks instance types using advanced metrics, including:
    - **Embodied Emissions**: (Lower is better) Evaluates the environmental impact of manufacturing and deploying the instance type.

This ensures your Kubernetes clusters are optimized for both cost-efficiency and environmental sustainability.

> This feature ensures you get **maximum cost efficiency** and **minimum emissions** while maintaining performance and reliability.
> This feature works with the `ksctl cluster create` command.
