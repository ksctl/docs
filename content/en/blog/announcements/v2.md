# Announcing Ksctl v2: A New Era of Effortless Kubernetes Management

We're thrilled to announce the release of **Ksctl v2**! This major update is designed to simplify your Kubernetes journey‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre a seasoned operator or just starting out. With v2, we‚Äôve reimagined the way you interact with your clusters, taking away the pain of endless command-line flags and help lookups, and putting a smooth, intuitive experience at your fingertips.

## ü§î Why Ksctl v2?

If you‚Äôve ever found yourself repeatedly typing `ksctl create --help` just to recall the right flag, you‚Äôre not alone. Ksctl v2 was born out of our commitment to make Kubernetes cluster provisioning as frictionless as possible. Here‚Äôs what we aimed to solve with this release:

- **Simplified User Experience:** Now, you simply specify the resource and the associated action, and Ksctl takes care of the rest‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs listing VM types, regions, Kubernetes versions, or even providing cost insights on cloud resources.
- **Lowering the Entry Barrier:** We know that new users often struggle with the complexities of Kubernetes.
  - Ksctl v2 is designed to be developer-friendly by offering clear defaults and guided choices Currently we help to sort out suitable cloud provider instance_type, and made sure that architecture x86 is used for maximum compatibility. Though we are working on adding support for arm architecture as well. And also in future we will be adding comparision feature for cloud providers like AWS vs Azure vs GCP, arm vs x86, AWS vs Azure _(From Cost, Your Application Requirement based recommendations to Sustainability)_. **So that you can focus on utilizing amazing Kubernetes technology, not configuring, ü´°**
- **Unified Tooling:** Expanding beyond just a cluster provisioning tool, Ksctl now incorporates enhanced capabilities for cluster management, and add-on support‚Äîall streamlined under one roof.


## üÜï What‚Äôs New in Ksctl v2?

This release brings a host of improvements and new features to transform your Kubernetes management experience:

> Redesign of Ksctl core: `provisioner` and `cluster management` components

### Enhanced Cloud Credential Management
- **Flexible Credentials:** Cloud providers will now receive credentials directly from the client. This change empowers you to choose your credential source while ensuring providers get them securely via context variables. For now all credentials will be stored in your local system. for which you need to check out `$ ksctl configure ...` command.

### Advanced Cluster Management
- **New Cluster-Management Controller:** We‚Äôve introduced a controller for managing clusters, allowing you to deploy it even on clusters not created with Ksctl. Initially focused on Ksctl-created clusters, this functionality is poised to become universally applicable.
- **Self-Managed Clusters:** The old `ha` keyword is replaced with `selfmanaged` to clearly indicate the type of cluster you‚Äôre operating.

### Networking & Node Operations
- **Cilium eBPF CNI with Hubble UI:** Cilium now comes with the hubble UI enabled by default, enhancing your cluster‚Äôs observability.
- **Safer Node Deletion:** A node drain step is now performed before any node deletion, ensuring smoother operations.

### Robust State Management & Addons
- **Improved State Document:** We've migrated versioning for components like Aks, Eks, Kind, HAProxy, and Etcd to a new field, ensuring better consistency and smoother migrations.
- **New Addons System:** Customize your cluster with our new addons framework. Simply specify the addons you want (e.g., switching CNI from ‚Äúnone‚Äù to ‚Äúcilium‚Äù) in your configuration, and let Ksctl handle the rest.

  Here‚Äôs a snippet of how you can specify your addons:

  ```json
  {
    "cluster_name": "test-e2e-local-cilium",
    "kubernetes_version": "1.32.0",
    "cloud_provider": "local",
    "storage_type": "store-local",
    "cluster_type": "managed",
    "desired_no_of_managed_nodes": 2,
    "addons": [
      {
        "label": "kind",
        "name": "none",
        "cni": true
      },
      {
        "label": "ksctl",
        "name": "cilium",
        "cni": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### New Tools & CLI Improvements
- **Two New Kubernetes Controllers:** Meet [ksctl/ka](https://github.com/ksctl/ka) and [ksctl/kcm](https://github.com/ksctl/kcm)! These controllers manage the application stack and cluster management addons respectively.
- **Streamlined CLI Operations:**
  - **Self-Update Command:** Keeping your CLI up-to-date is now a breeze.
  - **Improved Cluster Connection:** When you run `$ ksctl cluster connect`, your kubeconfig is automatically merged into `~/.kube/config` and the current context is set accordingly.
  - **Bug Fixes & Enhancements:** From loading cloud credentials to scaling self-managed clusters, we‚Äôve addressed several key issues to enhance reliability.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Compatibility Notice

With this release, we're making significant changes that break backward compatibility:
- **Module Transition:** We are transitioning to the module name `github.com/ksctl/ksctl/v2`.
- **Cloud Provider Update:** The `civo` cloud provider has been completely removed.

Please ensure you update your references and workflows accordingly to take full advantage of Ksctl v2‚Äôs capabilities.

## In Conclusion

Ksctl v2 is more than just an update‚Äîit‚Äôs a rethinking of the Kubernetes management experience. Our goal is to empower Developers with a tool that handles the complexity behind the scenes, letting you focus on deploying and managing clusters with ease and help you all create amazing software. Whether you‚Äôre provisioning your first cluster or managing a fleet of production environments, Ksctl v2 is here to streamline your operations.
