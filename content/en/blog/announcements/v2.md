## Why Ksctl v2?

It aims to find the rough edges with a lot of command line flags and the constant struggle of doing `ksctl create --help` to find the right flag.

The new version of Ksctl is released to make it more user-friendly and to provide a better user experience where users just need to mention the resource and its associated action and Ksctl will take care of the rest. from giing a list of vm types, regions, kubernetes versions to costs of cloud resources.

We have also expanded ksctl from just a cluster provisioning tool at heart whose aim is to make it as developer firndly as possible. and reduce the entry barrier for new users in k8s ecosystem.

From our experience, we have seen that the new users find it difficult to get started with k8s and we aim to make it as easy as possible for them. like choosing the right vm type, region, k8s version, and cost of cloud resources. at the time of creation with flexibilty to know if we should go ahead to arm vs x86 or gcp vs aws or azure vs aws or selfmanaged vs managed all these will be taken care by ksctl from ~> v2 onwards. ;)
